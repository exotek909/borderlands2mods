# Borderlands 2 Mods
Collection of mods created by me.
Check this video from craig (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ee3BM1TQQ) to learn how to enable console commands so that you can load custom mods.
Paste any of my mods (unless stated otherwise) in your binaries BL2 folder (like you would paste craig's community patch .txt file).
The extension on all my mods is .exo as my own personal signature. It is still a .txt file, so you execute it just like any other mod with: exec (mod name).exo
